### An example of using D3.js to display the [daily earthquake feed from the USGS](https://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/feed/v1.0/geojson.php) on a Leaflet slippy map.

#### Animation shows the order of earthquakes in the viewing area (not scaled by the actual time between earthquakes).  Background map is a the ESRI Ocean Basemap.
